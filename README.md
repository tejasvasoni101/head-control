# head-control of ROTF
Integration of all sub systems in a single file ie.stepper, servo , chatbot and cv face detection head control.

• A waiter Robot capable of autonomously traversing in the restaurant, interacting and taking orders from customers.

• integration of emotion detection and face detection using Camera feedback for Real-Time face tracing
using Computer Vision and combining other peripheral systems(Navigation/Serving) into the head control of bot.

• Above Processing was performed on a head mounted Raspberry pi. Further Image Processing Algorithms like canny edge
and erosion were implemented for finding the traversable area through the Image taken from overhead camera.
